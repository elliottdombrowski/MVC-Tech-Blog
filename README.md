```

AS a programmer, I want to write about code.
WHEN I visit this site, I am able to view other user's posts, as well as the comments on each post.
WHEN I log in or create an account,
THEN I am able to create a post.
WHEN I visit my profile dashboard,
THEN I am able to view my account's credentials, my posts, and create a new post.
WHEN I revisit the home page, 
THEN I see my post featured among other user's posts.
